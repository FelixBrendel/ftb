* Macros
These macros can be defined by the user to adjust the behavior of ftb.

- =FTB_INTERNAL_DEBUG= enables ftb-internal checks and asserts
- =FTB_STACKTRACE_INFO= when enabled, the function =print_stacktrace= will print
  the stack trace of the current execution, this function is also used in other
  parts of ftb. If =FTB_STACKTRACE_INFO= is not set, no stack info will be
  printed also in these cases.
  - On linux systems, if additionally =FTB_STACKTRACE_USE_GDB= is defined, gdb
    will be used intanally to get a nice demangled view of the stacktrace. This
    macro only is relevant on Linux systems, it has no effect on other
    platforms.
- =FTB_GLOBAL_SHUTDOWN_HOOK= enable the =system_shutdown_hook= that is run when
  the program exits
